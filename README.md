# NaitOS

*Developing an OS just for fun purposes!!!*


## What is NaitOS???

NaitOS is an Operating System, that is currently under development, written by a young man with a lot of dedication.

At first, it was supposed to be a little "experiment", but now became a really good passion, and I'm really proud of myself.

## When commands'll be implemented???

I'm planning to make a lot of commands, but they'll become a part of the OS during the 1.0 release.
