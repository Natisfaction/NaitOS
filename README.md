# NaitOS
Coding an OS just for fun!!!

    ==================== Releases ====================
        - Release 0.0 (removed): added basic function
        - Release 0.1   (alpha): added GDT, IDT and service routines
        - Release 0.5    (beta): I'm going to add the scrollback function
        - Release 1.0 (hopefully full release): I'm going to fix the keyboard

    ==================== Commands ====================
    Right now the OS has the following commands:
        - help.     ---> Displays a list of commands
        - calc.     ---> A basic calculator
        - version.  ---> Displays the OS version

    IMPORTANT NOTE: the "enter" character is the '.' right now
