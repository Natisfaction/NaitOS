# NaitOS

*Developing an OS just for fun purposes!!!*


## What is NaitOS???

NaitOS is an Operating System, that is currently under development, written by a young man with a lot of dedication.

At first, it was supposed to be a little "experiment", but now became a really good passion, and I'm really proud of myself.

## What are the current commands???

Right now, the OS has the following command:
 - *help*    --> Displays the command list
 - *version* --> Displays the OS version
 - *calc*    --> Opens a basic calculator
 - *cls*     --> Clears the screen

    ***More coming up soon!!!***
